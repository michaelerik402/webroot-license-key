How to Activate Webroot License Key?
====================================

Webroot SecureAnywhere provides cloud-based antivirus and internet security solutions for personal and business use. To take full advantage of Webroot’s powerful protection features, users must activate the software with a valid license key. The license key, also referred to as a keycode, is a 20-character alphanumeric code provided upon purchase. Without activation, the Webroot software cannot perform essential security functions, such as scanning, real-time protection, and updates.
